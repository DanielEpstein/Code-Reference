Create an abstract Pet class that has abstract functionality (at least 3 methods). It must have a "string Name" read-only property that is filled by a paramater to the ctor. At least one of the method must take in paramaters, and at least one of the methods must return a value instead of printing things to the console.

Create four implementations of the Pet class that all appropriately implement the different methods.

Allow the user is done entering in pets, allow the user to
A) select a pet
B) perform an operation
	- You will have to collect the arguments from the user requred to invoke a method that has paramaters.
C) Repeat A-B until the user decides to quit
