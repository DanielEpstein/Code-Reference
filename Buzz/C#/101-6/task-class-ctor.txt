Your goal is create a Car class that has the same state as what is defined below.
HOWEVER; make each field private, and create a read only property that allows get access
to each one.

Create a ctor that accepts name, year, number of doors and color and assigns
each param to the correct field. Delete the paramaterless ctor.

In main: create two car with different arguments passed into the ctor, and have them be
displayed by using the Display() mehtod.
