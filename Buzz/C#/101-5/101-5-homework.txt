Write a basic product inventory system that allows the user to enter product names and product prices (allow for cents; currency type is irrelevant) and save that data to a file called inventory.txt

The program will load that data again (if the files exists - exception handling) when it starts.

The program will allow the user to enter new products, remove existing products and display current products.

The product will use enums to track state, and should use different methods correctly to keep individual method line count down.

No individual method should be larger than 50 lines of code.
