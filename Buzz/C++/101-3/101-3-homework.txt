Modify vending machine

At the beginning of the program, allow the user to enter 4 products (name and price). You do not need to support names with spaces in them (but you may if you wish) - and you still do not need to woryy about input validation.

The rest of the program will continue to hehave as before, except that products must be displayed to the user in ascending order of price (bubble sort).

No fuctions allow other than main!
