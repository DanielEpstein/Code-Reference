Create an amended version of last weeks homework, as follows:

User a Product structure to contain n Name, Price and Description.
Allow for [0 to many] products to be added by the user.
Every time a Product is added, print all product to a file.
Eveyy time the program is started, read in all products from a file.
Continue to make sure that everything is sortable.

In main() have a basic state machine using enums (simlar to that show in the class) for a Main Menu that allows you to:
A} Add a new product
B} Sort products
C} Display products
E} Exit Program

(the function main() has no line limit, but that's not an excuse to place functionality in main() that should be elsewhere). 

All other functions must obey the same limit as previously - remember; this is an OVERLY generous line limit!!
